Overview

This program provides a minimal command-line interface for managing
tasks. It supports adding, listing, editing, marking, and deleting
tasks. Each command may define define its own flags, but several input
rules or concepts are shared across commands.

Concepts and Input Rules

Task

- A task consists of a required name and the following optional fields:
  deadline, status, tags, and memo.
- All fields except the name may be omitted.
- Task names do not need to be unique, but non-unique names may make it
  difficult or impossible to identify a task by name or by a regular
  expression, especially for commands such as edit or mark.

Tags

- Tags must be given as a space-separated string (e.g., work urgent).
  - The value of TAGS is parsed as one argument. If your shell splits
    words, quote the entire tag list (e.g., 'work urgent').
- Only ASCII letters A-Z (case-insensitive) are allowed.
- Tags are stored in uppercase form.
- A maximum of ten tags may be provided.
- Duplicate tags are ignored.
- Tag order is not significant.

Dates and Time

The DEADLINE field accepts either a date or a full ISO-8601 local
datetime.

- Date only: YYYY-MM-DD
  - time defaults to 23:59:59
- Date with time: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS

Additional rules:

- Timezones or UTC offsets are not allowed.
- All values are interpreted as local time.

Status

The Statuses that may be designated differ by command.

allowed statuses: - list: done, undone, due, overdue - mark: done,
undone - delete: done, overdue

Target Selection

Commands such as edit, mark, and delete require selecting one or more
target tasks.

- A task may be targeted by providing a regular expression that matches
  its name.
- For the delete command, multiple targets are allowed.
- For edit and mark, exactly one target must be specified.

Filters

- The list and delete commands apply all provided filters using logical
  AND (no OR is supported).
- Tag filters are also ANDed: a task matches only if it contains all of
  the specified tags.

Logging

By default, successful commands produce no output, following the Unix
tradition of “silence on success.” However, you can enable the global
--verbose flag to display additional information about successful
operations.
