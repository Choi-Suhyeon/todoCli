A simple command\-line task manager
.SS Overview
This program provides a minimal command\-line interface for managing
tasks.
It supports adding, listing, editing, marking, and deleting tasks.
Each command may define define its own flags, but several input rules or
concepts are shared across commands.
.SS Concepts and Input Rules
.SS Task
.IP \(bu 2
A task consists of a required name and the following optional fields:
deadline, status, tags, and memo.
.IP \(bu 2
All fields except the name may be omitted.
.IP \(bu 2
Task names do not need to be unique, but non\-unique names may make it
difficult or impossible to identify a task by name or by a regular
expression, especially for commands such as \f[CR]edit\f[R] or
\f[CR]mark\f[R].
.SS Tags
.IP \(bu 2
Tags must be given as a \f[B]space\-separated string\f[R] (e.g.,
\f[CR]work urgent\f[R]).
.RS 2
.IP \(bu 2
The value of \f[CR]TAGS\f[R] is parsed as one argument.
If your shell splits words, quote the entire tag list (e.g.,
\f[CR]\(aqwork urgent\(aq\f[R]).
.RE
.IP \(bu 2
Only ASCII letters A\-Z (case\-insensitive) are allowed.
.IP \(bu 2
Tags are stored in uppercase form.
.IP \(bu 2
A maximum of ten tags may be provided.
.IP \(bu 2
Duplicate tags are ignored.
.IP \(bu 2
Tag order is not significant.
.SS Dates and Time
The \f[CR]DEADLINE\f[R] field accepts either a date or a full ISO\-8601
\f[B]local\f[R] datetime.
.IP \(bu 2
Date only: YYYY\-MM\-DD
.RS 2
.IP \(bu 2
time defaults to 23:59:59
.RE
.IP \(bu 2
Date with time: YYYY\-MM\-DDTHH:MM:SS
.PP
Additional rules:
.IP \(bu 2
Timezones or UTC offsets are not allowed.
.IP \(bu 2
All values are interpreted as local time.
.SS Status
The Statuses that may be designated differ by command.
.PP
allowed statuses: \- list: \f[CR]done\f[R], \f[CR]undone\f[R],
\f[CR]due\f[R], \f[CR]overdue\f[R] \- mark: \f[CR]done\f[R],
\f[CR]undone\f[R] \- delete: \f[CR]done\f[R], \f[CR]overdue\f[R]
.SS Target Selection
Commands such as \f[CR]edit\f[R], \f[CR]mark\f[R], and \f[CR]delete\f[R]
require selecting one or more target tasks.
.IP \(bu 2
A task may be targeted by providing a regular expression that matches
its name.
.IP \(bu 2
For the \f[CR]delete\f[R] command, multiple targets are allowed.
.IP \(bu 2
For \f[CR]edit\f[R] and \f[CR]mark\f[R], exactly one target must be
specified.
.SS Filters
.IP \(bu 2
The \f[CR]list\f[R] and \f[CR]delete\f[R] commands apply all provided
filters using logical AND (no OR is supported).
.IP \(bu 2
Tag filters are also ANDed: a task matches only if it contains all of
the specified tags.
.SS Logging
By default, successful commands produce no output, following the Unix
tradition of \(lqsilence on success.\(rq However, you can enable the
global \f[CR]\-\-verbose\f[R] flag to display additional information
about successful operations.
